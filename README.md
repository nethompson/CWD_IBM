This is a public repository for Python code to simulate chronic wasting disease (CWD) in free-ranging white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) using an individual-based modeling framework. 

This code is used to assess Michigan, USA deer and CWD dynamics in Thompson et al. 2024 ("An individual-based model for direct and indirect transmission of chronic wasting disease in free-ranging white-tailed deer").

The underlying deer movement model was developed by Butts et al. 2022 ("Data-driven agent-based model building for animal movement through Exploratory Data Analysis")
